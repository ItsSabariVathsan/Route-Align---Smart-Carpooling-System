## Project Overview

Route Align is an intelligent carpooling platform designed to optimize urban commuting by leveraging AI-driven route optimization, real-time ride matching, and predictive analytics. This system addresses common limitations of traditional ride-sharing apps by adapting dynamically to real-time traffic conditions and user preferences, thereby reducing traffic congestion, lowering carbon emissions, and improving commuter convenience.

---
## Features

- AI-based ride matching considering route overlap and preferences  
- Real-time dynamic route optimization with live traffic data  
- Predictive analytics to forecast ride demand and improve availability  
- User registration, ride scheduling, and fare estimation  
- Multi-modal transport integration (future scope)  
- User reputation and eco-points system for incentivizing green behavior

## System Architecture

### Ride Matching Module

The Ride Matching Module is the core intelligence engine that identifies optimal pairings between drivers and riders. It uses machine learning algorithms to analyze user preferences, real-time GPS locations, time windows, and route overlap to suggest the best matches. Unlike traditional systems that only match based on destination, this module considers:

- Midpoint overlaps
- Historical trip patterns
- Detour tolerance
- Time flexibility

This ensures high-quality, efficient pairings that minimize travel time and improve user satisfaction.

---
### Dynamic Routing Engine

This module dynamically plans and updates travel routes based on current traffic conditions, weather data, and user locations. It continuously monitors:

- Live traffic feeds (via integrated APIs)
- Road closures or diversions
- Real-time rider/driver positions

By recalculating the fastest and most efficient route for each ride, it ensures that all participants take the shortest and most convenient path, minimizing delays and fuel consumption.

---
### User Management System

The User Management System handles registration, authentication, profile management, and role-based access (Driver or Rider). It supports:

- Secure sign-up and login with validation
- Profile preferences (e.g., preferred travel times, seat availability)
- Rating and reputation tracking
- Eco-point tracking for sustainable travel incentives

This module forms the user interface backbone, ensuring all interactions are personalized and secure.

### Database & API Integrations

This foundational layer manages data storage, retrieval, and synchronization. It connects all modules and ensures consistency across the system. Components include:

- **Database**: Stores user profiles, ride history, schedules, and feedback.
- **External APIs**:
    - Traffic and mapping (e.g., Google Maps API)
    - Weather forecasting
    - Location services

The API layer facilitates real-time data flow between internal services and external systems, enabling responsive and context-aware functionalities.
